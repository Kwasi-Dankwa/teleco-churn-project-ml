# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

Predicting and understanding customer churn behavior using data-driven techniques.

# Why it matters

* Churn reduces recurring revenue
* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Higher churn leads to lower customer value
* Growth Barrier: Higher churn undermines customer acquisition efforts
* Product or service Insight: Churn can signal dissatisfaction, competition, pricing issues or usability problems.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project explores customer churn for a telecommunications company using exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning. The objective is to identify key drivers of churn and develop predictive models that can help telecom businesses improve customer retention.

The datset is sourced from an IBM Dataset on Kaggle [`Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## 🚀 Objectives

- Analyze customer demographics and service usage
- Identify key factors influencing churn
- Build predictive models to classify churned customers
- Provide actionable insights through data visualization

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Comprehensive EDA (missing values, distributions, correlations)
- Feature engineering for categorical and numerical attributes
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Business-oriented interpretation of results

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

---

## 📈 Results Summary

- Top features contributing to churn:
  - Contract type
  - Monthly charges
  - Tenure
  - Customer service calls
- Best model: Random Forest with an F1-score of XX% and AUC of XX%
- Clear recommendations for churn mitigation
